# BPM Analyzer - Guide

## Introduction

This guide explains how to interpret the outputs of the BPM Analyzer script, providing insights into what each piece of information means and how to make sense of it in the context of tempo analysis. Understanding these details will help you get the most out of the tool for applications like music production, audio research, or performance. (For simplicity, we are assuming the script is being used for musical understanding.)

## Outputs Explained

### 1. **Estimated Overall Tempo**

**Example:**
```bash
Estimated overall tempo: 128.00 BPM
```

- **What it means:** The overall tempo represents the average beats per minute (BPM) of the entire audio file. The script calculates this by detecting the onset of beats in the waveform.
  
- **How to understand it:** If you're familiar with BPM in music, you can relate this number to the typical speed or energy of a song. For instance:
  - **60-90 BPM:** Slow tempos, often used in ballads, chill tracks, or ambient music.
  - **100-120 BPM:** Medium tempos, typical for pop, dance, or rock music.
  - **120-140 BPM:** Fast tempos, common in electronic, dance, or fast-paced genres.
  - **160+ BPM:** Extremely fast, often seen in genres like drum and bass or techno.

### 2. **Total Segments Analyzed**

**Example:**
```bash
Total segments analyzed: 12
```

- **What it means:** This tells you how many 5-second segments of the audio file were processed. Each segment's BPM is analyzed separately.
  
- **How to understand it:** The audio is broken into smaller chunks to provide a more granular view of the tempo over time. If the file is longer, more segments will be analyzed. Each segment is approximately 5 seconds in duration, so for a 60-second audio clip, there would be around 12 segments.

### 3. **Valid BPM Values Detected**

**Example:**
```bash
Valid BPM values detected: 10
```

- **What it means:** This indicates how many of the analyzed segments yielded a valid BPM reading within a reasonable range (between 40 and 250 BPM). 

- **How to understand it:** Only BPM values that fall within this range are considered because extremely slow or fast tempos are typically not meaningful in most musical contexts. If this number is much lower than the total segments analyzed, it might indicate segments where the tempo could not be reliably measured (e.g., in sections with silence or minimal beat structure).

### 4. **Mean Segment BPM**

**Example:**
```bash
Mean segment BPM: 127.50
```

- **What it means:** The mean BPM is the average of the BPM values detected across all valid segments.
  
- **How to understand it:** This average gives you a better sense of the overall tempo stability across the track. If the mean is close to the overall tempo, it indicates the tempo is relatively consistent throughout the track. 

- **Mental Model:** A mean close to the overall tempo means that the song maintains a steady beat. A large difference between the mean and overall tempo could suggest tempo fluctuations or irregular rhythms.

### 5. **Median Segment BPM**

**Example:**
```bash
Median segment BPM: 127.00
```

- **What it means:** The median is the middle BPM value when all valid BPMs are sorted in order. This provides a measure of central tendency that is less influenced by outliers.

- **How to understand it:** If some segments have extreme BPM values (perhaps due to noise or tempo changes), the median is more robust than the mean. A median close to the overall BPM suggests that most segments have BPMs near the estimated overall tempo.

- **Mental Model:** If the median differs significantly from the mean, there may be irregular tempo changes or noisy data affecting the results. A close median and mean generally indicate consistent tempo.

### 6. **Standard Deviation of BPM**

**Example:**
```bash
Standard deviation: 1.50
```

- **What it means:** This measures the variability in the BPM values. A low standard deviation indicates that the BPMs across segments are very similar, while a high value suggests more variation in the tempo.

- **How to understand it:** If the standard deviation is small (e.g., <5 BPM), the tempo is quite steady throughout the track. A larger standard deviation (e.g., >10 BPM) might indicate a track with changing rhythms or tempo shifts.

- **Mental Model:** A low standard deviation means you can rely on the overall BPM estimate for a steady track. A higher value might prompt you to examine sections of the track where the tempo changes, such as breakdowns or transitions.

### 7. **Range of BPM**

**Example:**
```bash
Range: 125.00 - 130.00 BPM
```

- **What it means:** This shows the minimum and maximum BPM values detected across the segments. It helps you see the extremes in tempo over the course of the file.

- **How to understand it:** A small range indicates that the tempo is consistent across the track. A wide range suggests significant changes in the trackâ€™s pace, such as a gradual increase or sudden shifts in rhythm.

- **Mental Model:** If the range is narrow (e.g., 125 - 130 BPM), the song is likely consistent in tempo. A wide range (e.g., 90 - 150 BPM) could indicate a multi-tempo track, often seen in progressive or experimental music.

### 8. **Rounded BPM**

**Example:**
```bash
Rounded BPM: 128
```

- **What it means:** This is simply the overall tempo rounded to the nearest whole number. Many audio software tools expect BPM as an integer, and this value makes it easier for you to use in mixing or syncing tracks.

- **How to understand it:** This is the number you can use directly when setting up tempo-based tools (like beatmatching in DJ software or setting up a metronome).

- **Mental Model:** This is the practical tempo you will use for most audio tools.

### 9. **BPMs in Ascending Order**

**Example:**
```bash
BPMs in ascending order:
125.00
126.00
128.00
130.00
```

- **What it means:** This lists the valid BPMs detected in order from lowest to highest.

- **How to understand it:** Seeing the sorted BPMs can help you visualize tempo shifts or identify whether most of the segments cluster around a specific BPM. This is especially helpful in finding outliers or patterns in tempo variation.

### 10. **BPM Difference Alert**

**Example:**
```bash
ALERT: BPM difference between segments exceeds 20!
Maximum BPM difference: 22.50
```

- **What it means:** If the difference between the lowest and highest detected BPMs exceeds 20, the script triggers an alert. This indicates a potentially significant tempo change between sections of the track.

- **How to understand it:** If you see this alert, the track might include major shifts in tempo (e.g., from a slow intro to a fast section), which can affect how the track feels overall. This could be important for DJs, producers, or analysts who need to know if the song changes dramatically at some point.

- **Mental Model:** Use this alert to watch out for drastic tempo changes that may affect transitions or mood shifts in your audio track.
