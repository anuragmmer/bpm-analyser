## Let's break down the interpretation of the numbers on each graph:

1. **Tempo Graph:**
   - **Blue Line:** Each point on the blue line represents the tempo value (in beats per minute) for a specific audio segment.
   - **Orange Line:** Represents the smoothed tempo values obtained by applying a moving average to the original tempo values. This line provides a clearer trend by reducing short-term fluctuations.

2. **Noise (dB) Graph:**
   - **Blue Line:** Each point on the blue line represents the noise level (in decibels) for a specific audio segment. The noise level is derived from the root mean square (RMS) of the audio segment.

3. **Tonal Shift Graph:**
   - **Blue Line:** Each point on the blue line represents the tonal shift value for a specific audio segment. Tonal shift is calculated based on the chroma features of the audio.

## The meaning of tempo values, noise levels, and tonal shift values in the context of audio analysis:

1. **Tempo:**
   - **Tempo of 140 BPM (Beats Per Minute) vs. 180 BPM:**
     - A tempo of 140 BPM implies a moderately paced musical passage, often associated with genres like pop or rock.
     - A tempo of 180 BPM suggests a faster-paced musical passage, commonly found in genres like electronic dance music (EDM) or certain fast-paced rock and metal songs.
     - In general, tempo reflects the speed or pace of the music. Higher BPM values indicate faster tempos, while lower BPM values suggest slower tempos.

2. **Noise Level (in dB):**
   - **Noise Level of -10 dB:**
     - Indicates a relatively noisy segment with a high level of background noise. This could be due to instrument sounds, ambient noise, or other audio artefacts.
     - Keep in mind that dB values are logarithmic, so a small change in dB represents a significant change in sound intensity. More negative dB values indicate quieter audio.
   
   - **Noise Level of -10 dB:**
     - Low Noise Level (e.g., -40 dB): Suggests a quieter segment with minimal background noise. Lower values indicate cleaner audio without much interference or extraneous sounds.

3. **Tonal Shift:**
   - **Tonal Shift Values:**
     - Tonal shift measures the amount of change in the tonal content of the audio over time.
     - Higher tonal shift values suggest more significant pitch or harmonic content changes between consecutive segments. This could be indicative of a section with varied musical elements or a transition between different musical themes.
    
   -  **Tonal Shift of 0.1:**
      - A tonal shift value of 0.1 suggests a relatively small or gradual change in tonal content from one segment to the next. The musical characteristics or tonal qualities in the audio are not changing dramatically.

   - **Tonal Shift of 0.15:**
     - A tonal shift value of 0.15 indicates a slightly larger or more pronounced change in tonal content between consecutive segments. There is a more noticeable shift in the musical elements, which might correspond to a change in chord progression, melody, or overall tonality.

Understanding the relationships between these parameters allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the audio:

- A high tempo with a simultaneous increase in tonal shift might indicate an energetic and musically dynamic section.
- An increase in noise level alongside a rise in tempo could suggest a section with more intense and lively audio, potentially with louder instruments or vocals.
- Conversely, decreasing noise level and tonal shift might signal a quieter and more stable part of the audio.
